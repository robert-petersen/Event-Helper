## Future Improvements

- Some of the basic event templates will be for watch parties, gaming nights, and planning IRL get-togethers. I also plan on having a template that is customizable for events that don't fall into these categories, as well as a few customized templates for popular video games.
- Set up a dedicated server to run the bot
- A section explaining how to add the bot to your server
- A section to describe how to use the bots commands
- Feature to create a temporary role for the event so the bot can ping a reminder before the event and so members can ping important information to members that attended the event (organizer can enter the number of days it stays up)
- League of Legends custom games template
- Watch-party on discord template & choose a movie or show embed
