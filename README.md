# Event Helper

A bot to help discord servers and their users plan events and gatherings. Some of the basic event schemas will be for watch parties, gaming nights, and planning IRL get-togethers. I also plan on having a schema that is a little more customizable for events that don't fall into these categories as well as a few customized schemas for popular video games.
